    NoteMonk  is a web-based text editor application developed using webpack for bundling, React for frontend components, and Express.js for the backend. It features offline capability through service workers with workbox, uses IndexedDB for local data storage, and includes a Progressive Web App (PWA) manifest for installation on compatible devices. The application automatically saves content locally when the window loses focus and caches static assets for improved performance.
